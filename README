                            %filename     - File name of track, excluding extension
                            %fileext      - Extension on track

                            %ext          - Cannonical file extension for track type (recommended)

                        Default: "%artist/%album/%trackno2 %title.%ext"

EXAMPLES
        Organize LibraryA and LibraryB and LibraryC separately, in-place:
            mmerge -o LibraryA LibraryB libraryC

        Merges the contents of LibraryA, LibraryB and LibraryC into LibraryC.  Does not organize files in LibraryC.

        Merges the contents of LibraryA, LibraryB and LibraryC into LibraryC.  Also, organizes files in LibraryC.
